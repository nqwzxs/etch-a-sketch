# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) consisting of a web page with sketchpad.

In this project, I learned a little bit of CSS Grid, used loops to generate squares in the grid, added event listeners to each square which call function to draw if mouse is over a square.
